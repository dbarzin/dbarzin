Hi there, I'm Didier, a technology and information security enthusiast. I started my career as an information security Ninja, defending information systems against cyber threats using my Jedi skills. However, I also have another side to me that comes out at night, that of a benevolent hacker. I love using my skills to support the values of open source and firmly believe in them.

I believe that technology can be used to improve people's lives, but this can only be done if we work together and share our knowledge. That's why I'm also a strong advocate of collaboration and openness in the tech industry.

May the source code be with you!
